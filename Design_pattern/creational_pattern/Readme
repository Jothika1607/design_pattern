Creational Pattern: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            A Creational Pattern is a type of design pattern that focuses on the process of object creation, providing solutions to instantiate objects in a way that enhances flexibility and reuse of code. These patterns abstract or manage the instantiation logic to ensure that the creation process is controlled and decoupled from the specific classes being instantiated. 


Key Characteristics of Creational Patterns :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Encapsulation: Encapsulate the logic of object creation to avoid hardcoding class types. 

            Abstraction: Provide a higher level of abstraction for the creation process. 

            Flexibility: Allow dynamic object creation, enabling systems to adapt to changes more easily. 

            Reusability: Promote reusable creation logic for similar types of objects. 


Examples of Creational Patterns :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            Factory Method: Creates objects without specifying their exact class. 

            Singleton: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point. 

            Builder: Constructs complex objects step-by-step. 

            Prototype: Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones from scratch. 

            Abstract Factory: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. 

These patterns are especially useful in scenarios where the creation of objects is complex, requires fine control, or needs to be decoupled from the main logic of the application. 



Example:  Factory Method Pattern for CRUD Operations in E-Commerce :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the context of a Creational Pattern and CRUD operations for an e-commerce platform, let's consider using the Factory Method pattern to create different types of products (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Books). Each product type can have its own creation logic, and we can handle CRUD operations for them in a way that is extensible. 

We'll define a ProductFactory that creates specific product types. Then, we'll implement simple CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Go.
